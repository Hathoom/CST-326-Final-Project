===Implemented for Milestone 1===

-Player can move on the x-y plane within the limitation of the camera view/screen
-Camera moves relative to the player's movement, but its "stuttery"

=================================

===Didnt finish in Milestone 1===

-Player model doesn't rotate (tilt left or right) depending on x-input
-Player model doesn't move smoothly with camera movement (NEEDS FIXING)
